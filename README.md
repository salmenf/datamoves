# datamoves: Interactive cheat sheet for data moves

This is a companion piece for my Master's thesis. It is a website introduces the concept of Data Moves. 

Data Moves are actions in data science which change the content, values or structure of a dataset.

The idea is mainly based on a [paper from 2019](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0mg8m7g6) introducing the name 'Data Moves', but uses a custom set of Data Moves.
